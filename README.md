# Doki2-canceled
This is the entire repository of the canceled game called Doki2, a standalone fan-made
production based on Doki Doki Literature Club.
A first completed chapter, included in project is actually playable, but not
for everyone.
Game dialogues is writed in Polish, so recommending this as a usual game is a suicide.

But you may ask me? "Why you uploading a canceled game, in a polish language, on a github?"

# Answer: For Modding and Testing
Yeah, im not kidding.
